# Kinodynamic Planning via Branch-and-Cut over Roadmaps 

Experimental data for the paper "Kinodynamic motion planning via Branch-and-Cut over Roadmaps":

 - Arxiv link: TBD

The Jupyter notebooks with the analysis of our experimental results can be found inside the folder `notebooks` along
with a compressed tarball `results.tar.bz2` with the raw output of our experimental framework. The 
`notebooks/analysis_support.py` contains I/O routines to load the data and arrange it in a convenient format
for analysis. `notebooks/plots.py` contains data plotting routines.

Notebooks are prefixed with `speed` when they contain the analysis of experiments in which speed constraints were
active.

The instances we used in the paper 
can be found [on this Github repo](https://github.com/miquelramirez/BARN_dataset), as retrieved from 
[Prof. Xuesu Xiao's website](https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/Research/BARN_Challenge/BARN_Challenge.html) in
